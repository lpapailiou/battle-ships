# BattleShips
A __battle ships__ mobile game allowing single and multi player games on android.  
Created as FFHS project in spring 2020 in collaboration with [@ramonator00](https://github.com/ramonator00) and [@SandroBuerki](https://github.com/SandroBuerki).

## The game
Classic rules apply.  
Two game modes are available:
- single player mode: play against random bot
- multi player mode: play against other players

Multiplayer games require a network connection with wifi (and friends). If you play without network connection, moves are saved locally and synchronized at the time of reconnecting.  
  
Several games can be managed in parallel. Games can be paused as well.  
If a game is finished, scores are taken into account. Overall scores will be accessible in a ranking view.
